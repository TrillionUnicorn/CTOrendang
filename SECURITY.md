# Security Policy

## 🔒 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously at CTOrendang. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** Create a Public Issue

Security vulnerabilities should not be reported through public GitHub issues.

### 2. Report Privately

Send details to: **security@ctorendang.com**

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Session-based authentication (Lucia Auth v3)
- ✅ Secure password hashing (bcrypt, 12 rounds)
- ✅ OAuth 2.0 (Google, GitHub)
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ✅ Session expiration and rotation

### Data Protection
- ✅ HTTPS enforced (TLS 1.3)
- ✅ Secure cookies (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- ✅ Environment variables for secrets
- ✅ Database encryption at rest
- ✅ Encrypted backups

### Input Validation
- ✅ Zod schema validation
- ✅ SQL injection prevention (Prisma ORM)
- ✅ XSS protection (SvelteKit auto-escaping)
- ✅ CSRF protection (SvelteKit built-in)
- ✅ Rate limiting

### API Security
- ✅ Rate limiting (100 req/15min)
- ✅ Request size limits
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Webhook signature verification
- ✅ API key rotation

### Infrastructure
- ✅ DDoS protection (Cloudflare)
- ✅ WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- ✅ Regular security updates
- ✅ Automated vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Error monitoring (Sentry)

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### 1. Environment Variables
```bash
# ❌ Never commit secrets
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

# ✅ Use .env files (gitignored)
# ✅ Use environment-specific configs
```

#### 2. Password Handling
```typescript
// ✅ Always hash passwords
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 12);

// ❌ Never store plain text passwords
// ❌ Never log passwords
```

#### 3. Input Validation
```typescript
// ✅ Validate all inputs
const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(8)
});

// ❌ Never trust user input
```

#### 4. Database Queries
```typescript
// ✅ Use Prisma (prevents SQL injection)
await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { email } });

// ❌ Never use raw SQL with user input
```

### For Users

#### 1. Strong Passwords
- Minimum 8 characters
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- Use a password manager

#### 2. Two-Factor Authentication
- Enable 2FA when available
- Use authenticator apps (not SMS)

#### 3. Account Security
- Don't share credentials
- Log out on shared devices
- Review account activity regularly
